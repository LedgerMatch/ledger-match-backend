# LedgerMatch Backend

> Stellar payment reconciliation workbench — service and indexing layer.

## Role

A reconciliation engine that matches internal payment records against Stellar transaction and operation data, highlighting missing, duplicated, delayed, or mismatched settlements.

The backend exists to handle work that should not happen in a browser: indexing,
normalization, scheduled checks, API aggregation, persistence, reconciliation, and
operational diagnostics. It does not custody user signing keys.

## Service boundaries

- **API:** exposes read models and controlled application operations.
- **Indexer/jobs:** consumes Stellar data and converts it into application-friendly records.
- **Storage:** keeps operational data off-chain while retaining references to verifiable
  Stellar events.
- **Observability:** records failures and processing latency without storing secrets.

## Local setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

## Reliability

Workers should be idempotent. A network timeout must not silently create a duplicate
business record. Reprocessing the same Stellar event should converge to the same state.

## Security

Never put secret keys in logs. Validate all external input. Keep RPC credentials and
database credentials server-side. Production deployments should add rate limits,
structured logging, backups, alerting, and secret rotation.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Implement project-specific data model
- [ ] Add Stellar ingestion
- [ ] Add retry and idempotency handling
- [ ] Add database migrations
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Add metrics and structured logs
- [ ] Add production runbook
